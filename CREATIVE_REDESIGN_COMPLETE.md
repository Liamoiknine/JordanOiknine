# üé® Creative Portfolio Redesign - Complete!

## ‚úÖ What Was Built

Your portfolio has been completely transformed from a template-style site into a distinctive, creative experience that breaks conventional patterns.

## üöÄ The New Experience

### Landing: Portal Navigation
Instead of a traditional hero + navbar, visitors now encounter a **minimal portal** with three interactive cards:

1. **Work** - Projects and research
2. **Story** - Personal narrative and journey  
3. **Connect** - Get in touch

Each card is hover-interactive and leads to its own unique "room" of the site.

### Work View: Magazine Editorial
- **Featured Project** takes up 60% of the screen with editorial layout
- Large image, bold typography, clean spacing
- Other projects in asymmetric grid below
- Click any project ‚Üí slides in full detail view with next/prev navigation
- Floating navigation to jump between sections

### Story View: Personal Narrative
- **Editorial layout** with sidebar photo (like a magazine profile)
- Personal philosophy statement replacing generic bio
- "Why Biotech?" and "Building Something Meaningful" sections
- **Horizontal scrolling timeline** of experiences
- Click any timeline item ‚Üí expands in modal overlay
- All 5 experiences integrated: Soccer, UNICEF, DECA, Lawncare, Coaching

### Connect View: Minimal & Genuine
- Centered, super clean layout
- Direct contact links (Email, LinkedIn, GitHub)
- Large, tappable cards
- Personal note: "I'm always excited to connect with people who share my interests..."
- No form clutter
