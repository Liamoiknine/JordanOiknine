## Routes Changed

| Old Route | New Route | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| `/` | `/` | Now portal landing |
| `/#about` | `/story` | Personal narrative |
| `/#experience` | `/story` | Integrated in timeline |
| `/#leadership` | `/story` | Integrated in timeline |
| `/#projects` | `/work` | Projects showcase |
| `/#contact` | `/connect` | Contact panel |
| `/projects/[slug]` | `/work/[slug]` | Project details |

## Design Patterns

### Portal Pattern
Entry point presents three exploration paths without overwhelming the user. Each path is clearly labeled and interactive.

### Magazine Layout
Projects view uses editorial magazine design with:
- Large featured item
- Asymmetric grid
- Hierarchy through size and placement

### Editorial Narrative
Story view uses magazine editorial pattern:
- Sidebar image
- Long-form text
- Horizontal scrolling elements
- Expandable details

### Minimal Contact
Connect view strips away form complexity:
- Direct links only
- Large, tappable areas
- Clean hierarchy

## Animation Philosophy

### Entrance Animations
- Staggered fade-ins
- Y-axis slides
- Delay timing for rhythm

### Interaction Animations
- Hover scales and lifts
- Click feedback (whileTap)
- Smooth color transitions
- Modal slide-ins

### Page Transitions
- Fade between views
- Layout animations for nav state

## Mobile Considerations

### Portal (Mobile)
- Vertical stack of cards
- Full-width tappable areas
- Same interaction patterns

### Work View (Mobile)
- Featured project full-width
- Single column grid
- Touch-friendly project cards

### Story View (Mobile)
- Photo above content
- Vertical timeline
- Modal expansion on tap

### Connect View (Mobile)
- Stacked links
- Large touch targets
- Same minimal aesthetic

## Performance

- Static site generation for all routes
- Optimized images with Next.js Image
- Code splitting by route
- Minimal JavaScript bundles

## Build Output

```
Route (app)                              Size     First Load JS
┌ ○ /                                    1.64 kB         133 kB
├ ○ /connect                             2.33 kB         134 kB
├ ○ /story                               5.65 kB         143 kB
├ ○ /work                                3.83 kB         141 kB
└ ● /work/[slug]                         2.38 kB         140 kB
```

All routes are statically generated for optimal performance.

## Key Takeaways

This redesign transforms a template-style portfolio into a distinctive, memorable experience by:

1. **Breaking conventions** - No standard navbar, non-linear navigation
2. **Prioritizing content** - Projects and story take center stage

4. **Being authentic** - Personal voice instead of corporate speak
5. **Showing craft** - Design decisions demonstrate creativity

The result is a portfolio that stands out while remaining functional and accessible.
